## Overview

Talking with users and writing developer documentation are different.

With users, use common words whenever possible. Write like you speak. Consider simple everyday words first.

With developers, formal and written language, and even technical terms usually take higher precedence.

A few interesting cases (in alphabetical order):

| User              | Dev             |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| Keyboard shortcut | Key binding     |
| Link to heading   | Slug; Anchor ID |
| Math block        | Display math    |
| Settings          | Configuration   |
