# TextMate grammar guide

## Introduction

A **TextMate language grammar** ("**TextMate grammar**", or "**TM grammar**" in short) is a descriptive form of specifying tokenization rules, which was invented for the TextMate editor and has been adopted by numerous editors. It is a structured collection of Oniguruma regular expressions, and is typically written as a plist (XML) or JSON file.
