title: 'Slugify rules for Hugo'
---

Hugo has been using [goldmark](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark) since v0.60.0 released on 2019-11-27.

Hugo allows to set ID auto-generation method by `autoHeadingIDType` since v0.62.2 released on 2020-01-05.

Thus, there is no `hugo` in `markdown.extension.toc.slugifyMode`.
