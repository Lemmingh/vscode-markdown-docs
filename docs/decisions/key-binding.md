## Overview

Assign a key binding only when it's necessary and essential. Popularity matters.

## Rich text editing

The key bindings for basic rich text editing follow the conventions from other rich text editors.

## List editing

Hook VS Code's default key bindings for selection editing, mainly including line operations and indentation operations.

Although this may introduce some strange compatibility issues, its learning cost is the lowest.

## Miscellaneous

Minimize conflicts.
