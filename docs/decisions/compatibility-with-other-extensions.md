## Markdown preview

This extension uses [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) to render HTML, and contributes to VS Code's built-in Markdown preview.

It should work harmoniously with other extensions that follow [VS Code's guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/markdown-extension).
